# AccessibilityWork
## Description
 
As a developer, it is important to develop applications that meet accessibility standards.  In other words, a website uses viewer-friendly styling, ensures assistive technologies can read the webpage for end users with disabilities, includes meaningful image attributes, and in general follows a logical flow.  This not only enhances the end user's experience with a webpage, but also helps to optimize the page for search engines. 

Additionally, developers should practice writing "clean code" so that others who review a website's code can easily follow along.  This includes using standard naming conventions, writing HTML and CSS codes in a logical flow, consolidating code where possible, and always including comments to help guide users.

The purpose of this project was to take existing code and improve upon it so it meets accessibility and general coding standards.  Some changes that were made include:
    1. Restructuring CSS and HTML code into a logical format
    2. Consolidating CSS code where applicable
    3. Correcting display and position of icons and image elements
    4. Adding accessible alt attributes
    5. Updating header and title attributes
    6. Updating comments throughout the stylesheet

This exercise was a great first step in better understanding the basics on website accessibility and structuring code, while also grasping display, positioning, and box-model concepts.

This project is just the beginning.  Going forward, we will get into more advanced coding to design responsive website and provide end users with a more interactive experience.
